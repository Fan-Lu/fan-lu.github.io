I'm a postdoc scholar in the Department of Applied Mathematics at [UCSC](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/applied-mathematics/). 
Prior to joining UC Santa Cruz, I was a research assistant in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at 
the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering 
from the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) in 2023, 
under the guidance of [Prof. Sean Meyn](https://meyn.ece.ufl.edu/about/). 
My research interests include reinforcement learning, deep learning, and their applications to solving complex 
real-world problems, spanning domains such as robotics and biological systems.
