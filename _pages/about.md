Fan Lu is a Machine Learning Scientist at [Boston Bioprocess](https://bostonbioprocess.com/about/our-team), 
where he develops machine learning, 
reinforcement learning, and large language models to optimize bioprocess development and 
decision-making. 

Prior to joining Boston Bioprocess, he was a postdoc researcher in the Department 
of Applied Mathematics at [UCSC](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/applied-mathematics/), 
where he designed machine learning and computer vision systems for wound healing prediction and 
personalized treatment recommendations. 

He earned his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) 
under the supervision of [Prof. Sean Meyn](https://meyn.ece.ufl.edu/about/). 
His research focuses on developing scalable and reliable AI systems 
that integrate reinforcement learning, deep learning, and large language models to solve complex real-world 
problems, spanning domains in biological systems, robotics, and healthcare.
