I'm a postdoc researcher at [UCSC](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/applied-mathematics/), 
exploring possibilities of accelerating wound healing using deep reinforcement learning.
I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) in May 2023, 
under the guidance of [Prof. Sean Meyn](https://meyn.ece.ufl.edu/about/). My research interests include 
reinforcement learning, deep learning, and their applications to solving 
complex real-world problems, spanning domains such as robotics and biological systems.
