Description:  We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach to expedite the wound 
healing process. Our method efficiently divides the vision-based control task into two distinct 
modules: a perception module and a controller module. By separating vision-based control into a 
perception module and a controller module, we train a DRL agent without sophisticated mathematical 
modeling. Our research demonstrates the algorithm's convergence and establishes its robustness in 
accelerating the wound-healing process. The proposed DRL methodology showcases significant potential 
for expediting wound healing by effectively integrating perception, control, and predictive modeling, 
all while eliminating the need for intricate mathematical models.
