title: "Model-Free Characterizations of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation and Convex Q-Learning in Continuous Time"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-10-14-MPQ-aXiv
excerpt: 'Convex Q-learning is a recent approach to reinforcement learning, 
motivated by the possibility of a firmer theory for convergence, 
and the possibility of making use of greater a priori knowledge 
regarding policy or value function structure. This paper explores 
algorithm design in the continuous time domain, with finite-horizon 
optimal control objective. The main contributions are 
(i) Algorithm design is based on a new Q-ODE, which defines the model-free 
characterization of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. 
(ii) The Q-ODE motivates a new formulation of Convex Q-learning 
that avoids the approximations appearing in prior work. 
The Bellman error used in the algorithm is defined by filtered measurements, 
which is beneficial in the presence of measurement noise. 
(iii) A characterization of boundedness of the constraint 
region is obtained through a non-trivial extension of recent 
results from the discrete time setting. 
(iv) The theory is illustrated in application to resource allocation 
for distributed energy resources, for which the theory is ideally suited.
