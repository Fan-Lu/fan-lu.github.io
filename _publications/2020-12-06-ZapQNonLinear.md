excerpt: 'Zap Q-learning is a recent class of reinforcement learning algorithms, 
motivated primarily as a means to accelerate convergence. 
Stability theory has been absent outside of two restrictive classes: 
the tabular setting, and optimal stopping. This paper introduces a new framework 
for analysis of a more general class of recursive algorithms known as stochastic 
approximation. Based on this general theory, it is shown that Zap Q-learning is 
consistent under a non-degeneracy assumption, even when the function approximation 
architecture is nonlinear. Zap Q-learning with neural network function approximation 
emerges as a special case, and is tested on examples from OpenAI Gym. Based on multiple 
experiments with a range of neural network sizes, it is found that the new algorithms 
converge quickly and are robust to choice of function approximation architecture.'

We propose RetailNet, an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL)-based neural network, to
achieve efficient selling strategies for perishable
products in order to maximize retailersâ€™ long-term
profit. We design pair-wise multi-Q network for
Q value estimation to model each state-action pair
and to capture the interdependence between actions. Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
and Entropy are incorporated into the loss function for balancing the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. Experiments show that RetailNet efficiently produces the near-optimal solution, providing practitioners valuable guidance on
their inventory replenishment, pricing, and products display strategies in the retailing industry.
