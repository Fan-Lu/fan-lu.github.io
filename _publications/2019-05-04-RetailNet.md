Strategies via Pair-Wise Multi-Q Learning"

excerpt: 'We propose RetailNet, an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL)-based neural network, to
achieve efficient selling strategies for perishable
products in order to maximize retailers’ long-term
profit. We design pair-wise multi-Q network for
Q value estimation to model each state-action pair
and to capture the interdependence between actions. Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
and Entropy are incorporated into the loss function for balancing the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. Experiments show that RetailNet efficiently produces the near-optimal solution, providing practitioners valuable guidance on
their inventory replenishment, pricing, and products display strategies in the retailing industry.
