permalink: /publication/2019-11-03-SLAM-ICML
excerpt: 'Moving vehicles in formation, or platooning, can
dramatically increase road capacity. While traditional control methods can manage fleets of
vehicles, they do not address the issues of dynamic road conditions and scalability (i.e., sophisticated control law redesign and physics modeling). We propose a modular framework that
averts daunting retrains of an image-to-action neural network, provides flexibility in transferring
to different robots/cars, while also being more
transparent than previous approaches. First, a
convolutional neural network was trained to localize in an indoor setting with dynamic foreground/background. Then, we design a new deep
reinforcement learning algorithm named Momentum Policy Gradient (MPG) for continuous control tasks and prove its convergence. MPG is
sucessfully applied to the platooning problem
with obstacle avoidance and intra-group collision
avoidance.
