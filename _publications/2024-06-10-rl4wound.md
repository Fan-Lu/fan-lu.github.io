excerpt: 'Finding the optimal treatment strategy to accelerate wound healing is of utmost importance,
but it presents a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the process.
We propose an adaptive closed-loop control framework that incorporates deep learning, optimal control,
and reinforcement learning to accelerate wound healing. By adaptively learning a linear representation
of nonlinear wound healing dynamics using deep learning and interactively training a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) agent for tracking the optimal signal derived from this representation without the need
for intricate mathematical modeling, our approach has not only successfully reduced the wound healing
time by 45.56% compared to the one without any treatment, but also demonstrates the advantages of offering
a safer and more economical treatment strategy. The proposed methodology showcases a significant potential
for expediting wound healing by effectively integrating perception, predictive modeling, and optimal
adaptive control, eliminating the need for intricate mathematical models.
